title: Best Rational Representation of Double-Precision Floating Point Number
tags: [ math, C# ]
---

IEEE double-precision floating-point numbers are rational numbers. Their denominator
is always a power of two. For example, the double-precision representation of 1/3 is
actually

$$
\frac {6\ 004\ 799\ 503\ 160\ 661} {2^{54}} = \frac {6\ 004\ 799\ 503\ 160\ 661} {1\ 801\ 439\ 850\ 948\ 1984}
$$

but in a more concise form where the exponent of the denominator is stored instead of
the full denominator.
In C# we can use `BitConverter` to extract the bits from a `double` to reveal its 
secrets.

```csharp
public record Rational(BigInteger p, BigInteger q)
{
    public static explicit operator Rational(double d)
    {
        const int exponentBits = 11;
        const int mantissaBits = 63 - exponentBits;
        const int exponentMask = (1 << exponentBits) - 1;
        const int exponentBias = exponentMask / 2 + mantissaBits;
        const long mantissaMsb = 1L << mantissaBits;
        const long mantissaMask = mantissaMsb - 1;

        var bits = BitConverter.DoubleToInt64Bits(d);
        var sign = bits < 0 ? -1 : +1;
        var exponent = (int)(bits >> mantissaBits) & exponentMask;
        var mantissa = bits & mantissaMask;

        if (exponent == 0)
        {
            exponent = 1;

            if (mantissa == 0)
            {
                return new Rational(BigInteger.Zero, BigInteger.One);
            }
        }
        else
        {
            mantissa |= mantissaMsb;
        }

        exponent -= exponentBias;

        if (exponent >= 0)
        {
            return new Rational(BigInteger.Pow(2, exponent) * mantissa * sign, BigInteger.One);
        }

        var p = (BigInteger)mantissa;
        var q = BigInteger.Pow(2, -exponent);
        var g = BigInteger.GreatestCommonDivisor(p, q);
        return new Rational(p * sign / g, q / g);
    }
}
```

There are an infinite number of possible rational numbers that result in the same
double-precision value for 1/3. The rational 1/3 could be considered the "best" of these
in the sense that it has the smallest numerator or denominator of all of them.

If we want to recover the "best" rational representation of a double-precision number
we just need to find the one with the smallest denominator that is within the range
of the number plus-or-minus a half [ULP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_in_the_last_place).
We can get the bounds of this range by taking the exact rational value, doubling the
numerator and denominator, and then subtracting or adding one to the numerator.

Continued fractions give us a way to find the rational with the smallest
denominator that is within this range. But first we need to know how to get the continued
fraction representation of a rational number. This is straightforward from the definition
of a simple continued fraction: just take the integer portion (via division) as the 
first term, then loop using the reciprocal of the fractional portion.

Note the special handling for negative numbers due to the behavior of `DivRem`. This
uses the `Negate` function from a [previous post](2021-02-21-continued-fractions-to-decimal).

```csharp
public static IEnumerable<BigInteger> FromRatio(BigInteger p, BigInteger q)
{
    if (p.Sign * q.Sign == -1)
    {
        foreach (var d in Negate(FromRatio(BigInteger.Abs(p), BigInteger.Abs(q))))
        {
            yield return d;
        }

        yield break;
    }

    while (true)
    {
        var d = BigInteger.DivRem(p, q, out var r);
        yield return d;

        if (r.IsZero)
        {
            yield break;
        }

        (p, q) = (q, r);
    }
}
```

If we apply this to the exact ratio for the double-precision expression 1.0 / 3 we get

```
[0; 3, 6004799503160661]
```

which is telling us that the double-precision representation is off by the
desired value by 1 part in 6 quadrillion. Close enough for most applications but
certainly not all.

The end-points of the half-ULP range are

$$
\frac {12\ 009\ 599\ 006\ 321\ 321} {36\ 028\ 797\ 018\ 963\ 968} \lt 
\frac 1 3 \lt 
\frac {12\ 009\ 599\ 006\ 321\ 323} {36\ 028\ 797\ 018\ 963\ 968}
$$

The continued-fraction representations of these endpoints are

```
[0; 3, 2401919801264264, 5]
[0; 2, 1, 12009599006321322]
```

If we want to create the most concise continued fraction that is between these two values,
it's clear that it starts with [0; ...] and the next term must be either 2 or 3. But
[0; 2] is outside the range and [0; 3] is inside the range, so we choose [0; 3]. We got the obvious value 1/3 as the simplest rational number within the range.

For a more interesting case, let's use $$\pi$$. Using `Math.PI` we get the ratios

$$
\frac {1\ 768\ 559\ 438\ 007\ 109} {562\ 949\ 953\ 421\ 312} \lt 
\frac {884\ 279\ 719\ 003\ 555} {281\ 474\ 976\ 710\ 656} \lt
\frac {1\ 768\ 559\ 438\ 007\ 111} {562\ 949\ 953\ 421\ 312}
$$

The value and endpoints have continued-fraction representations

```
Math.PI + ½ ULP: [3; 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 14, 6, 2, 14, ...]
Math.PI:         [3; 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 14, 3, 3, 2, ...]
Math.PI - ½ ULP: [3; 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 14, 2, 5, 11, ...]
```

Notice that the terms go wrong right where they disagree with the +/- half
ULP terms. The actual terms of $$\pi$$ start with

```
[3; 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 14, 2, 1, 1, ...]
```

It looks like the simplest continued fraction between the two endpoints would be

```
[3; 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 14, 3]
```

but in fact it is 

```
[3; 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 14, 2]
```

When comparing simple continued fractions, the terms in odd-number positions are in 
"reverse order" because of the reciprocal operation that occurs between terms. This 
is the 13th term (counting the whole-number term as term 0) so we want to increase 
the next, 14th term, which is 5, to infinity in the limit. That's the same as just 
truncating after the 13th term. 

This truncated continued fraction is the rational number 

$$
\frac {165\ 707\ 065} {52\ 746\ 197}
$$

This is considerably more concise than the exact rational double-precision value and yet 
it has the exact same double-precision representation.
