Links to pages with values computed to 25 decimal places of continued fractions with terms that are polynomial in their index.
These are intended for people to find by search engine if they have a value and they're wondering if there's an expression that
explains it. Some of these are in [OEIS](https://oeis.org) but many are not.

There are 10,000 polynomials per page, sorted by absolute value of highest-degree coefficients within each page. Polynomials are
generated in "score" order before being grouped into pages. The score of a polynomial is

$$
\begin{align}
score&=deg(P) + \sum_{i=0}^{i\le deg(P)} \left|a_i\right| \\
P &= \sum_{i=0}^{i\le deg(P)}a_i x^i
\end{align}
